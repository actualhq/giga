    "There are a few steps that need to be completed in order to do this. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine the default cost drivers for the country, and the code for the country that can be used with Project Connect APIs. Create a json file that has these parameters, see [here](conf/countries/rwanda.json) for an example of how to structure this file.\n",
    "2. To drive the models, you need additional data for this country: electricity (optional), fiber node data, cellular tower data. You can find the format for these in the sub-sections below. Aggregate the data that you will need and place it in the workspace for this country.\n",
    "3. You can add a new country by using the CLI as follows:  `./run add-new-country <your-country-parameters.json> <path-to-country-workspace> <PROJECT_CONNECT_API_TOKEN>`. This will register the country and make it available to the library models, fetch the most up to date school data for that country, merge that data with any existing workspace data like electricity data, and create a cache for schools and infrastructure data\n",
    "4. Synchronize the new country data with remote storage, the current CLI is setup to work with an object store called Google Cloud Store, where all the workspace blobs/artifacts are persisted and updated using `./run upload-workspace <path-to-country-workspace>`\n",
    "5. You are all set! After the updated version of the application has been re-deployed, the new country will be available to run models against \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that step 3 above combines multiple commands into a single executable for simplicity.\n",
    "If you want to run each of these commands separately see the [Appendix](#appendix) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on how you can use the `run` CLI, see the descriptions below (to generate the help text, execute `./run` from command line without any input arguments, see [here](run#L53) for the description):\n",

    "## Preparing a Data Workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a new workspace or update an existing workspace that houses the data needed to drive the models.\n",
    "This data is composed of the following:\n",
    "* Fiber nodes: fiber node locations in the region of interest\n",
    "* Cell towers: cell tower locations, height, and technology availability in the region of interest\n",
    "* Electricity: electricity availability at the schools of interest\n",

    "1. Aggregate the external non-connectivity data needed to run the models: fiber node locations, cell towers, electricity availability. You can find the reference datasets [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XwXNGr4DPifuIOW1cAesE8_wJOvOlKC0?usp=share_link).\n",
    "2. Populate the workspace with the up to date school information from project connect APIs\n",
    "3. Generate any additional artifacts that can be used in a cache\n",
    "\n",
    "To add the latest school set from the project connect APIs you can run the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./update_schools.py --workspace-directory <model-workspace> --country <country-of-interest> --api-token <project-connect-api-token>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can generate a pairwise distance cache to help warm-start the fiber model for efficient compute using the CLI below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./create_fiber_distance_cache.py --workspace <model-workspace>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can generate a pairwise distance cache to help warm-start the cellular model using the CLI below:\n",

    "```bash\n",

    "./create_p2p_distance_cache.py --workspace <model-workspace>\n",
    "```\n",
