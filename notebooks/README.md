# Model Notebooks

The notebooks in this directory are used for two primary purposes:

1. Serve as interactive dashboard through which models can be configured, executed, and their outputs analyzed
2. Serve as tutorials or example "drivers" of how a particular model can be used.

## Notebook Glossary

The dashboard notebooks are as follows:

* [Cost Estimation](cost-scenario.ipynb): estimates the CapEx, OpEx, and NPV connectivity costs by technology and using the cheapest technologies

The "driver" notebooks are as follows:

* [Fiber Model](fiber-model.ipynb): demonstrates how to initialize and run the key nodes in the fiber model
